This is a command-line chess app that I built in python to beat a friend! It has an integrated chess engine so if a player needs help, they can consult it for the most optimal move. 
Allows 2 players to play. 

Some features: 
1. Intuitive command-line interface
2. Stockfish chess engine integrated to help players
3. Proper move validation. Random moves aren't allowed! All moves must abide by the rules of chess
4. Commands to help players

To use this clone the repo and cd into it 
Then install required libraries: 
1. pip install python-chess

And install stockfish: 
1. brew install stockfish

Useage: 
python chess_bot.py
